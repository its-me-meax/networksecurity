# Network Security Analysis and Monitoring System

This repository contains a comprehensive network security analysis and monitoring system that uses machine learning to detect and analyze network traffic patterns. The system is built using Python and includes data processing, model training, and a web interface for monitoring network security events.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.x
- **Web Framework**: Flask (app.py)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn/TensorFlow (based on model requirements)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy

## Key Components

### Core Files
- `app.py` - Flask application for web interface
- `main.py` - Main application logic and orchestration
- `push_data.py` - Data ingestion and processing
- `setup.py` - Package installation and configuration
- `test_mongodb.py` - Database connection testing

### Configuration Files
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `dockerfile` - Docker container configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-me-meax/networksecurity.git
cd networksecurity
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure MongoDB:
```bash
# Ensure MongoDB is installed and running
python test_mongodb.py
```

4. Docker Setup (Optional):
```bash
docker build -t networksecurity .
docker run -p 8080:8080 networksecurity
```

## Usage

1. Start the web interface:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Process network data:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Push new data to the system:
```bash
python push_data.py
```

## Features

- Real-time network traffic monitoring
- Machine learning-based threat detection
- Data visualization and reporting
- MongoDB integration for data storage
- Dockerized deployment option
- Web interface for system management
- Automated data processing pipeline

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create a new branch
2. Implement your changes
3. Update tests if necessary
4. Submit a pull request

### Data Schema
The `data_schema` directory contains database models and data structure definitions. Refer to this when making changes to data handling.

### Model Training
Models are stored in the `final_model` directory. Use the provided scripts for training and validation.

## Monitoring and Logs

- Application logs are stored in the `logs` directory
- Network data is processed and stored in `Network_Data`
- Validated data samples are kept in `valid_data`
- Model artifacts are saved in `Artifacts`
