# Network Security Projects for Phishing Data

## Overview
This project focuses on building a data pipeline for ingesting, storing, and processing phishing-related datasets for network security analysis.

## Data Ingestion
The **data ingestion pipeline** loads raw phishing data from various sources into **MongoDB**, ensuring reliable storage and easy retrieval. It handles **schema alignment, data consistency, and indexing**, which builds a strong foundation for validation, preprocessing, and downstream analytics.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB** – for reliable data storage and indexing  
- **Python** – for automation and data ingestion scripts  
- **Pandas** – for preprocessing and basic transformations
